TASKS
Beginner Level :
Reading a File and Printing Content
Write a Python function that opens a .txt file and prints each line to the console. The file should
contain at least 5 lines. Use a try-except block to handle any potential errors (like file not found).
Writing to a File
Write a Python function that takes a list of strings as input and writes each string as a new line to a
.txt file. If the file already exists, it should overwrite the existing content.
